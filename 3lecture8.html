        <p>A way you can organize elements on a page without using relative or absolute positioning, is by using the css style file and changing the text padding, margin and size until it looks how you want it to.</p>

        <p>I chose the colors I did because it looks yummy like chocolate covered strawberries. The colors I used are complemtary as well. I like the soft pink and chocolate/reddish brown combo a lot! I think the website turned out really cute with this colors. They're also nice on the eyes!</p>

        <p>I give this assignment a 3/5, it was fairly easy to understand but I'm afraid some things went over my head. I'm unsure of how to make this assignment easier to digest.</p>
